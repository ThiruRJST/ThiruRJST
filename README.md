"If you're worrying on something that you really care about, You don't have to be pushed. The vision pulls you" - Steve Jobs

"Everything that exists in this world has a hidden pattern" - Ramanujam 

So I deal with finding this hidden pattern in data. Statistics is my frenemy which guides me in this darkness. Tensorflow and Pytorch are the tools I use to teach my machine. Recently got obsessed with signal data and it's classic viz.

I like to work in team. Love coffee too much hence, Started the career as Java developer. but, now into computer vision and research with python and c++ in my arsenal.
